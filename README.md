## Quantum Advantage Seeker with Kernel

QuASK is a quantum machine learning software written in Python3 that facilitates researchers in designing, experimenting, and assessing different quantum kernels' performance. This software is platform agnostic and can be integrated with all major quantum software platforms (e.g. IBM Qiskit, Xanaduâ€™s Pennylane, Amazon Braket). QuASK guides the user through a simple preprocessing of the classical data in input, applies quantum kernels that are either user-specified or already pre-existing and analyzes the result in generalization error. It allows for the generation of parametric quantum kernels that can be trained using gradient-descent-based optimization, grid search, or genetic algorithms. Projected quantum kernels can be used to mitigate the curse of dimensionality induced by the exponential scaling dimension of many-qubits Hilbert spaces. QuASK can also generate the observable values of a quantum model and use them to study the prediction capabilities of the quantum and classical kernels.


## Project name, project webpage and project GitHub repository

- [ ] use `main` branch for production-ready state only
