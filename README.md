Add description


## Project name, project webpage and project GitHub repository

- [ ] add repository topic: [procedure](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). 
  Choose between:
  - [ ] QML (quantum machine learning)
  - [ ] QTI (quantum technology initiative)
- [ ] use `main` branch for production-ready state only
- [ ] create `develop` branch for the latest delivered development changes for the next release
- [ ] create your development branch where each contributor works on a daily basis

##  Missing Requirements for the README
 Full description of the project
- [ ] Description of the project 
- [ ] How to install 
  - [ ] definition of virtual environment (anaconda/venv) used
  - [ ] instruction to install the package (requirements.txt or setup.cfg etc)
  - [ ] instruction how to run the code
- [ ] Quick start: minimal working example / tutorials / demos

##  Requirements for the CODE
- [ ] `requirements.txt` or `environment.yaml`(for conda) or `setup.cfg + pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`([setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/))
- [ ] `src/packagename` folder with source files
- [ ] formatting: production code must be formatted with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- [ ] function annotations: augment all functions and modules with [dosctrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

##  Requirements before promoting the project from private to public
- [ ] `bibliography.md`: Zenodo link to external papers and datasets used
- [ ] Semantic versioning: comply with [semver.org](https://github.com/semver/semver/blob/master/semver.md) and [apache.org](https://apr.apache.org/versioning.html)
- [ ] documentation: using [readthedocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/) and [simple formatting rules](https://hplgit.github.io/teamods/sphinx_api/html/sphinx_api.html). Please, use one of the following two standards: [Google's docstring](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) or [Numpy's docstring](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard).
