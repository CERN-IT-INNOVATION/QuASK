## Quantum Advantage Seeker with Kernel

QuASK is a quantum machine learning software written in Python that 
supports researchers in designing, experimenting, and assessing 
different quantum and classic kernels performance. This software 
is package agnostic and can be integrated with all major quantum 
software packages (e.g. IBM Qiskit, Xanaduâ€™s Pennylane, Amazon Braket).
QuASK guides the user through a simple preprocessing of input data, 
definition and calculation of quantum and classic kernels, 
either custom or pre-defined ones. From this evaluation the package 
provide an assessment about potential quantum advantage and prediction 
bounds on generalization error.
Beyond theoretical framing, it allows for the generation of parametric
quantum kernels that can be trained using gradient-descent-based 
optimization, grid search, or genetic algorithms. Projected quantum 
kernels, an effective solution to mitigate the curse of dimensionality 
induced by the exponential scaling dimension of large Hilbert spaces,
is also calculated. QuASK can also generate the observable values of
a quantum model and use them to study the prediction capabilities of
the quantum and classical kernels.

## Installation

The software requires Python3 version 3.9.10 or newer. The easiest way
to install the software is through PiP packet manager, using the command:

```python3 -m pip install quask```

or by downloading the software directly from this repository:

```python3 -m pip install https://github.com/QML-HEP/quask/archive/master.zip```
