Advanced use of QuASK
=========================

These series of tutorial dig in the advanced feature of _quask_. In the first tutorial we 
show how to make _quask_ rely on one of the existing backends (Qiskit, Pennylane, Braket, Qibo, ...) 
as well as how to define a custom backend. Then, we will see particular feature that are not available
on most quantum machine learning frameworks. The second tutorial shows how to evaluate a quantum 
kernel according to several different criterias, and these can be used to diagnose poor performances of the model
or justify good ones. 


.. note::

    _quask_ is an ongoing project. If you need a certain functionality to be supported or modified, 
    contact us to see if it can be quickly integrated.
