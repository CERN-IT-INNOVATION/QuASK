    "## Expressibility of a parameterized quantum circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of _expressibility_ for $U(\\mathbf{x})$ can be understood as its capacity to distribute classical data throughout the Hilbert space of the quantum system. To formally quantify this expressibility, we rely on the norm of the super-operator $A$, given by $||A||=\\mathrm{Trace}[AA^\\dagger]$. This can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\int_\\text{Haar} (\\left|\\phi\\right>\\left<\\phi\\right|)^{\\otimes t} d\\phi - \\int_\\Theta (U(\\mathbf{\\theta}) \\left|0\\right>\\left<0\\right| U^\\dagger (\\mathbf{\\theta}))^{\\otimes t} d\\mathbf{\\theta},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is an integer with $t \\ge 2$ \\[sim19\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "The super-operator $A$ quantifies the extent to which the ensemble of states, obtained by initiating the system in $\\ket{0}$ and evolving it with $U(\\theta)$ (where $\\theta$ is randomly chosen), deviates from the Haar-random ensemble of states. The Haar-random ensemble represents a uniform distribution of quantum states throughout the Hilbert space. When this deviation is small, we consider the unitary $U$ to be expressible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As comparing a distribution to the true Haar-random distribution of states can be challenging, the concept of $\\varepsilon$-approximate state $t$-design is employed. This ensemble of states closely approximates the Haar random ensemble of states up to the $t$-th statistical moment, hence the parameter $t$. For $t = 1$, only the first statistical moment (the average) is considered, which is generally less informative. For $t=2$, both the average and standard deviation are taken into account, making it a suitable choice for most use cases. The higher the value of $t$, the more precise the quantification of the deviation, but the more computationally expensive the calculation becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the expressibility of the parameterized quantum circuit $U$ provides insights into the potential performance of the kernel that utilizes $U$. Further details on these aspects are covered in the tutorial [Spectral Bias](\"../tutorial_quantum/quantum_3_spectralbias.html\").\n"

Moreover, when we introduce a bandwidth parameter $\\beta$ to restrict the rotational angles, we effectively limit the region in which states can be mapped. In such cases, we may encounter a unitary transformation that, despite having an exponential number of generators, exhibits only mild expressibility."
