    "In the case of quantum kernels, we have observed that projections can reduce expressibility. However, a simple technique, akin to that used in Gaussian kernels, can be employed either in conjunction with or as an alternative to projection to control expressibility. This technique leverages the fact that any unitary $U(\\cdot)$ essentially performs rotations, with each parameter serving as a rotational angle. By constraining these angles within the range $[0, \\beta] \\subset [0, 2\\pi]$, we limit the capacity of $\\kappa$ to disperse vectors across the Hilbert space of the quantum system.
