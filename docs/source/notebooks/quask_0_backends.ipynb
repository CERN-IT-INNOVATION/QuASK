    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to use _quask_ with different backends. These APIs have been designed to allow us to work with quantum kernels at a high level, hiding all the hardware (or simulator) details. The current APIs are categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `core` package contains the high-level APIs, with the `Operation` class representing a gate, the `Ansatz` class that represents a parametric quantum circuit, and the `Kernel` abstract class representing the quantum kernel.\n",
    "- The `core_implementation` package contains the low-level implementation of the `Kernel` class on some quantum programming framework.\n",
    "- The `core.KernelFactory` class is used to instantiate `Kernel` objects on the chosen, pre-configured backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the [first tutorial on quantum kernels](quantum_0_intro.html) how to work with the Pennylane Backend in a noiseless simulation setting. Here we explore further options.\n"
