    "## Expressibility and curse of dimensionality in kernel methods\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with kernel methods, whether classical or quantum, we must exercise caution when working in high-dimensional (or even infinite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces. This is due to the fact that in high dimensions, certain unfavorable phenomena can occur, resulting in a kernel machine that, after the training phase, becomes a complex function prone to overfitting. These phenomena are explored in the [upcoming tutorial](xxx).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the classical context, the Gaussian kernel maps any $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ to a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution with an average of $\\mathbf{x}$ and a covariance matrix of $\\sigma I$. When $\\sigma$ is small, data points are mapped to different regions of this infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and $\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}') \\approx 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{x}'$. To avoid this, a larger $\\sigma$ is chosen to ensure that most data points relevant to our task have some nontrivial overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Hilbert space for quantum systems grows exponentially with the number of qubits $n$, similar challenges can arise when using quantum kernels. This situation occurs with expressible $U(\\cdot)$, which allows access to various regions within the Hilbert space. In such cases, similar to classical kernels, techniques must be employed to control expressibility and, consequently, the model's complexity."

    "### Projection as expressibility control\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of \\[Hua21\\], who initially addressed the challenge of the exponential dimensionality of Hilbert space in the context of quantum kernels, have introduced the concept of _projected quantum kernels_ to mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is straightforward: first, the unitary transformation $U$ maps classical data into the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Subsequently, a projection maps these elements back to a lower-dimensional Hilbert space. The overall transformation, thanks to the contribution of $U$, remains beyond the capabilities of classical kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single data point encoded in the quantum system, denoted as $\\rho_x = U(x) \\rho_0 U(x)$, projected quantum kernels can be implemented in two different ways:\n",
    "- We can implement the feature map $\\phi(x) = \\mathrm{\\tilde{Tr}}[\\rho_x]$, with $\\mathrm{\\tilde{Tr}}$ representing partial trace.\n",
    "- Alternatively, we can implement the feature map $\\phi(x) = \\{ \\mathrm{Tr}[\\rho_x O^{(j)}] \\}_{j=1}^k$, where the observable $O^{(j)}$ is employed for the projections.\n",
