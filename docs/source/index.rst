QuASK is a stable and actively maintained library for constructing, studying, and benchmarking 
quantum kernel methods. 

It is designed to simplify the process of choosing a quantum kernel, 
automate the machine learning pipeline at all its stages, and provide pedagogical guidance 
for early-stage researchers to utilize these tools to their full potential.

QuASK promotes the use of reusable code and is available as a library that can be 
seamlessly integrated into existing code bases. It can also be used as standalone 
software, such as CLI/GUI tools implemented in Python. 

QuASK is written in Python 3, 
can be easily installed using pip, and is accessible on PyPI.
